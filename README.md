IVPORT V2
======

IVPORT V2 is compatible with Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2

### IVPORT V2 is available at [HERE](http://www.ivmech.com/magaza/ivport-v2-p-107).

IVPORT and IVPORT V2 which are the first Raspberry Pi (also Raspberry Pi A,A+,B+ and Raspberry Pi 2,3 fully compatible) Camera Module multiplexer is designed to make possible connecting more than one camera module to single CSI camera port on Raspberry Pi. Multiplexing can be controlled by 3 pins for 4 camera modules, 5 pins for 8 camera modules and 9 pins for **maximum up to 16 camera modules** with using GPIO.

IVPort can be used for stereo vision with stereo camera.
### See wiki pages from  [here](https://github.com/ivmech/ivport/wiki).

IVPort has already been preferred by  ESA, MIT Lab, Spacetrex Lab, well known company research centers and numerous different universities. 

### Updated Notes

### [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4JZN7Y0d2o) of stereo recording with 2 camera modules

The closest approach to **simultaneous capturing** at **640x480 resolution with 7 fps** each camera connected to Ivport Camera Multiplexer (4 camera boards were connected.) by utilizing Raspberry Pi's video-capture capabilities with a JPEG encoder. See more details [here](https://github.com/ivmech/ivport/wiki/Capture-Sequence).
